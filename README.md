# Pho Voorhees Restaurant Website

<b> TLDR: </b>

A sucessful restaurant website should have:
 * a Filtered Menu (filtering Vegetarian, Vegan, and Glutten-Free options)
 * a Gallery of High-Def Photos of Menu Items / Products
 * Store Phone Number embedded
 * an Online-Ordering System embedded
 * a Delivery Service embedded
 * use fonts that are trasferrable to different languages when translated

I have worked at my aunt's Vietnamese restaurant ever since it opened in 2017 but now that I am in college, I only work there during my winter and summer breaks. 
<br> <br>
On one of my breaks from school, I noticed that many immigrant business owners, like my aunt, stuck with traditional ways of advertising themselves. Although paper and word-of-mouth methods work, I believed creating an online website would generate more sales and provide a more concise business image for the restaurant.
<br> <br>
While developing this website, I referenced many restaurant websites and learned that many lacked a filtered menu, an online menu that sorts through the items of the menu to display not only appetizers and entrees but also vegan, vegetarian, and glutten-free options. Thus, I considered this in my process, as well as using fonts that supported the Vietnamese language. I also noticed successful restaurants had online-ordering on their website. This online-ordering system is connected to the restaurant's Point-of-Sales system, which is very beneficial for Front-of-House staff because it minimizes the number of phone calls and time to take orders. I found this method to be very helpful during rush hour because my aunt's restaurant only has one company phone to take orders off of.
