# Pho Voorhees Restaurant Website

I am developing this website for my aunt's Vietnamese restaurant. I recently came to the realization that many immigrant business owners, like my aunt, do not have the skills or knowledge in producing a clear, conscise business image on the interent. So, as a result, I have been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a website that is easy-to-read, straightforward, and accessible in a variety of langugaes.
