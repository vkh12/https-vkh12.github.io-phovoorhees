# Pho Voorhees Restaurant Website

I am developing a website for my aunt's Vietnamese restaurant. 

I recently came to the realization that many immigrant business owners, like my aunt, do not have the skills and time to create a clear, conscise business image on the interent. As a result, I have been teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a website that is easy-to-read, straightforward, and accessible in a variety of langugaes that exactly portrays *her business*.
