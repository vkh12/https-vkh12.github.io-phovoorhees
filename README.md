# Pho Voorhees Restaurant Website

I have worked at my aunt's Vietnamese restaurant ever since it opened in 2017 but now that I am in college, I only work there during my winter and summer breaks. 

On one of my breaks from school, I noticed that many immigrant business owners, like my aunt, stuck with traditional ways of advertising themselves. Although paper and word-of-mouth methods work, I believed creating an online website would generate more sales and provide a more concise business image for the restaurant.

While developing this website, I referenced many restaurant websites and learned that many lacked a filtered menu, an online menu that sorts through the items of the menu to display not only appetizers and entrees but also vegan, vegetarian, and glutten-free options. Thus, I considered this in my process, as well as using fonts that supported the Vietnamese language.
