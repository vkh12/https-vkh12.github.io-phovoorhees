## Project Overview

I have been involved with my aunt's Vietnamese restaurant since its opening in 2017. During one of my breaks, I observed that many immigrant business owners, like my aunt, relied heavily on traditional advertising methods. Although approaches like printed materials and word-of-mouth are effective, I recognized the potential for an online presence to drive sales and enhance the restaurant's brand image.

## Development Insights

In developing this website, I analyzed various restaurant sites and identified common shortcomings, particularly the lack of a **filtered menu**. I implemented a feature that allows users to sort menu items by categories, including appetizers, entrees, and specific dietary options (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free). 

Additionally, I prioritized using fonts that support the Vietnamese language to cater to the restaurant's primary customer base. I also integrated an **online ordering system** that connects directly to the restaurant's Point-of-Sales system, significantly benefiting the Front-of-House staff. This integration reduces the volume of phone calls and expedites the order-taking process, especially during peak hours when my aunt's restaurant operates with limited resources.

## Conclusion

This project not only enhanced the restaurant's online visibility but also streamlined operations, making it a valuable asset for the business.
